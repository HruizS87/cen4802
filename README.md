Software Integration, Configuration, and Testing

My name is Hector Ruiz Silva. I'm currently entering my second to last semester here at Valencia and I'm looking forward to learning more about software development in this Software Integration, Configuration, and Testing course. 

This line is being added to differentiate between my "main" branch and the "readme-edit" branch.
